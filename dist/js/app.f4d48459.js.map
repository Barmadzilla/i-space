В Кошелёк встроен первый российский мобильный сервис бесконтактной оплаты Кошелёк Pay, который поддерживает карты Visa и Mastercard. А партнёры сервиса — крупнейшие розничные банки, в том числе Тинькофф, Банк ВТБ, Райффайзенбанк, МТС Банк, Альфа-Банк, и торговые сети: «Перекрёсток», «ВкусВилл», «Пятёрочка», «ЛЕНТА», «М.Видео», Adidas Group, Lamoda, United Colors of Benetton.</p>\n<p>История Кошелька — это история о том, как вот уже 8 лет мы балансируем между насущными потребностями наших пользователей и желанием привносить что-то кардинально новое в их пользовательский опыт. Мы до сих пор обсуждаем внутри команды, можно ли было дойти до той точки, в которой мы находимся сейчас, более простым путем. Но, кажется, что как и у любой большой и сложной истории, причинно-следственные связи не были линейными и каждый этап развития был по-своему важен.</p>\n<p>Читать полную версию <a
